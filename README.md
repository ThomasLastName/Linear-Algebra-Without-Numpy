# Linear-Algebra-Without-Numpy
This is the first stuff I wrote in Python, and was esentially a self-imposed exercise in the language.
That said, you never know if someone out there will find something of use in this code, which in principle could be optimized.
You will find code for LU decomposition, the method of successive over-relaxation, the conjugate gradient method, and more.
