# Linear-Algebra-Without-Numpy
No really, though, writing this was esentially a self-imposed exercise.
That said, you never know if someone out there will find something of use in this code, which could in principle be optimized.
You will find code for LU decomposition, the method of successive over-relaxation, the conjugate gradient method, and more.
